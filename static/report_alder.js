  //   participatory budget: the value IS the choice. Asking how their menu spending "changed"
  //   is a second derivative of a decision, and tells you less than the decision itself.
  //
  //   CHANGE, for what they INFLUENCE. Crime, businesses opening and closing: nobody should be
  //   judged on the ward they inherited — a ward with high crime in 2015 had high crime in 2011,
  //   and that is not the sitting alderperson's doing. The direction of travel during their term,
  //   measured against the average ward's, is the question that can fairly be asked.
  //
  // The list stays hand-picked: a face plotted against a number nobody could move is unfair to
  // the person and misleading to the reader. But excluding a measure people legitimately care
